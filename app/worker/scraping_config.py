You will be given a markdown-converted webpage by the user that should contain a news article, a blog post, a press release, or a similar piece of substantive content. Note that it may also contain other elements from the webpage that the content was hosted on, such as navigational elements, teasers for other articles, advertisements, etc. If such elements are present, you must ignore them and only focus on the substantive content.
If the substantive content contains information about upcoming events that are relevant to the following topic, you need to extract that information.
Topic name: {topic_name}
Topic description: {topic_description}
Topic country: {topic_country}
When determining the date of an upcoming event, keep in mind that today's date is {current_date}, and that the substantive content you are looking at was published on {publish_date}.
All extracted information should be in the following language: {language}.
Notice that the point of this task is to help in creating a forward planner with a list of upcoming events relating to the given topic, to be used by e.g. journalists or business analysts.
Therefore, you should only extract information about events that 1. lie in the future, 2. are specific enough to server as actionable items in a forward planner, and 3. are important enough to be newsworthy.
Examples of events that are sufficiently specific and important:
- The German parliament plans to vote on a new law about combatting hate speech on the 20th of August 2030. (date specific, event specific and important, actionable)
- The next hearing in the criminal case against the owner of the restaurant chain Blockhouse will take place on the 10th of July 2029, at 10:00 AM. (date and time specific, event specific and important, actionable)
- If Sony's board of directors cannot agree on a new CEO by the end of the year, the title will automatically pass to the company's founder. (date specific, event specific and important, actionable)
Examples of events that are NOT sufficiently specific or important:
- The German government plans to install a comittee for reviewing recent changes to the criminal code by the end of the year (date not specific, event somewhat vague, not actionable)
- Some pundits suspect that the French president will issue his resignation at his annual address on the 1st of January next year. (date specific, event important, but mere suspicion that the event might happen is not sufficient)
- The new law is expected to cause rents to go up once it takes effect on the 1st of January 2030. (starting date specific, but this is a broader, long-term development, not a specific event)
- The defendant has until the 20th of July 2031 to decide whether to appeal the verdict. (date specific, but this is merely a deadline, not an actual event)
- KPMG is hosting a seminar on best practices in accouting for students and young professionals (date specific, event specific, but not important / newsworthy)

You will be given the title and description of two events. 
Your response should indicate whether the two events both refer to the same real-world event, just with different wording and possibly different details, or whether they refer to different real-world events.
If they refer to different real-world events, leave the other fields in your response blank.
If they refer to the same real-world event, your response should intelligently merge their titles and descriptions into a single title and description.
When merging, try to preserve the most important information from both events.
However, if there is contradictory information, you should prioritize the information from the second event.
